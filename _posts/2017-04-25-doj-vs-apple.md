On 9 February 2016, the FBI ordered Apple to unlock an iPhone 5C that belonged
to a terrorist. Using the All Writs Act of 1789, the FBI ordered Apple to
develop software such that:

1. it will bypass or disable the auto-erase function whether or not it has been
enabled" (this user-configurable feature of iOS 8 automatically deletes keys
needed to read encrypted data after ten consecutive incorrect attempts)
2. it will enable the FBI to submit passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE for testing
electronically via the physical device port, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other protocol
available
3. it will ensure that when the FBI submits passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE,
software running on the device will not purposefully introduce any additional
delay between passcode attempts beyond what is incurred by Apple hardware

The order also specifies that Apple's assistance may include providing software
to the FBI that will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone so
that the software would only load and execute on the SUBJECT DEVICE.
