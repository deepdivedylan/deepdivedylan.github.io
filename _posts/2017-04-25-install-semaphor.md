Talking about security is useless without putting it to practice. Today, we will
download and install [Semaphor](https://spideroak.com/personal/semaphor), a
zero knoweledge team chat system similar to [Slack](https://slack.com) that is
encrypted from end-to-end and no plain text or identifiable information is
stored on SpiderOak's servers.
